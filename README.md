# Basic_HTML_and_CSS
I performed some very basic tasks during my learning time in HTML and CSS.

About my first web page task : 

While my first web page, created during my early exploration of HTML and CSS, lacks responsiveness, it's crucial not to jump to the conclusion that other tasks or projects will share the same trait. As I've grown into an expert in frontend development, I am determined to prioritize responsiveness and user-friendliness in all my projects, debunking any assumptions about non-responsiveness!!!!.

Below i have attached the image of the web page or else i have given the netlify link
